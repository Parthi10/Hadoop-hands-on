# Hadoop
*Learning how to tame the Big Data with Hadoop and related technologies*
* Hadoop is an **open source** software platform for **distributed storage** and **distributed processing** of **very large datasets** on **computer clusters** built from commodity hardware
* Why Hadoop?
  * Data is too big
  * Vertical scaling isn't an option
    * Disk seek times
    * Hardware failures
    * Processing times
  * Horizontal scaling is linear
  * You can do much more instead of just batch processing

## Installation
* Download Virtual Box from https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Download image of Hadoop to run on Virtual Box
  * (Horton Works Data Platform) **HDP 2.5 Sandbox** is preffered because it boots up faster than new versions
    * Download from https://hortonworks.com/downloads/#sandbox
* Import the image into Virtual Box
* Once you bootup, you will have CentOS instance that has Hadoop up and running
* We can use CLI, it also has browser interface
  * **Ambari** is available to easily navigate and manage different systems on Hadoop
  * Goto http://localhost:8888
* Launch Dashboard and login to Ambari
  * Username: maria_dev
  * Password: maria_dev
* #### Trouble shooting
  * Enable **virtualization** in your BIOS
  * Disable **Hyper-V acceleration** in Windows
    * this option is in the “Turn Windows Features On and Off” control panel
  * Make sure you have atleast 8+ GB of RAM
